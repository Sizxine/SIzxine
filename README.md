Hi, I'm Sizxine (or you can call me David)

I'm a Chemist with a passion for web3 and blockchain, where science meets innovation. I'm Community Manager of @BlockUniVN, The Blockchain Academic Community, focused on knowledge, building career paths, and technical aspects.

As I began building in Web3, I came to realize something essential:

Technology alone isn’t enough — understanding business is just as important.

But I haven’t lost sight of what brought me here: cutting-edge technology.

What I Care About

⚙️ Building systems that scale as users grow

🔒 Ensuring strong security from day one

🧼 Writing clean, high-quality, maintainable code

Now, I focus on creating crypto projects that are not only technically sound, but also strategically designed for real-world impact.

Because in the end, real success means making both — the code and the business — truly great.
